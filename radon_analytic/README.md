## General information

This program performs analytic evaluations of classical Radon transforms in 3D 
(along 2D planes) of analytic functions whose prototype should be realized 
in "test_function.c". 

File "test_function.c" contains an example of such realization. Note that 
ony the function with name "test_function" will be used for calculations. 
After realizaiton of your test function you have to compile the code 
so it can be used.
