The program computes ray transforms in 3D of analytic functions given in './test_functions/' (see testfun_tmplt.c).

Folder './test_functions' contains examples of such realizations. 
Note that ony the function named as 'test_function(...)' will be used for computations. 
After providing code of your test function you have to compile the code so it can be used.

Compilation

 1) Configure makefile to include your implementation of the test function in C
 2) run make with a parameter the name of your binary
