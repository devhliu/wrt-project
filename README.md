This is project is a part of my phd thesis conducted under the supervision of professor [Roman Novikov](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~novikov/)

Here we aim to develop new inversion methods for weighted (generaliezed) Radon transforms. 
The latter are of particular importance in various applications in the domain of inverse 
problems (e.g., in tomographies, geophysics). In particular, we work on methods which 
could be numerically more stable against the noise in tomographical data compared to existing methods. 

The very precise theoretical explanation of given algorithms is in [[2,3]](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~fedor.goncharov/publications.html).
